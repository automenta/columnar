Python , Pandas Pain Point Postponement

goals:
 - [x] simple, focussed on things that make pandas quite slow.
 - [x] parallelizable
 - [x] lazy, can prepare most transforms with delayed execution via flows
 - [x] off-heap tabular data manipulation, uses mmap and random access fixed-width file input for now
process-level cleanup 
- [x] composable design - thanks given to Arrow-Kt
